    <p>Hello, I am a Geography student at Brigham Young University. I have always loved maps and learning about places around the world. 
      I decided to Major in Geospatial Science and Technology and Minor in International development for these reasons and for the opportunity to do more with technology. 
      I am from Seattle and love to hike and look for animals on the beach when I'm at home.  margin-bottom: 10px;  box-shadow: 4px 8px;</p>
